## üìì Functionality & Concepts used

Starting from a very basic concept of Book store, a simple low-fidielty prototype was being made and then by adding additional features, considering the main aim in mind that was to make an user-friendly application, the wireframes were designed and in the above files u can see the final High-Fidelity prototype of our app.
The UI/UX of this app is made on Figma.

*Note: You have to import your files to Figma Software before accessing it.*
